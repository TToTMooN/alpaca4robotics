You are serving as a task-generation helper for a given robot environment. 

Here is the information about the environment. The environment is called {Two Block World} 
There is a 7DOF Franka robot with a parallel gripper. 
There are two blocks, {block A} and {block B}, with randomized sizes and density in the environment.
The Franka robot has a force sensor on the end effector.
The Franka robot is mounted on a table.
The blocks are initialized at a random position on the table.
Contents in the {} are the names of the objects in the environment.

Come up with 10 different tasks for the robot to perform.

Generate the response following the template below:
###Task {i}: {task description}
where {i} is the task number and {task description} is the task description.


An example task description is: {pick up the heavier block and place it on top of the lighter block}

The rules for task description:
1. Only include the objects in the environment in the task description.
2. The task description doesn't need to include all the objects in the environment.
3. You can assume the robot can do basic manipulation skills with a single parallel gripper.
4. The task description can be implicit in the objects. For example, {Pick up the heavier block} is a valid task description.
5. The task description can be implicit in the goal. For example, {Maximize the height by stacking the two blocks} is a valid task description.
6. Use your imagination to come up with different tasks. The tasks should be diverse and not too similar to each other.
7. The observation of the robot is the position and orientation of both blocks and the end effector of the robot, and the force sensor on the end effector. Try to devise tasks that are not trivial to solve with the initial observation. In other words, there are uncertainties in the task that requires the robot to explore the environment to solve the task. For tasks you think satisfy this requirement, please add a * at the end of the task description. For example, {pick up the heavier block and place it on top of the lighter block}*.
