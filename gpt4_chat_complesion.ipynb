If it\\'s not provided, it will be <noinput>.\\n\\nThe {output} consists of two parts <verbal> and <action>.\\n    - The <verbal> part include an description of the reasoning process and the current planned action.\\n    - The <action> part include a downstream action provided in the function lists executable by the robot. \\n\\nThe {instruction} of each task consists should consists of the following standard questions in order to provide chain of thought instructions pairs.\\n1. Is the current information enough to solve the task? If not, what information is missing?\\n2. What are the actions the robot should take to gather information?\\n3. What are the actions the robot should take to solve the task?\\nFor the 1st question, the <action> output part should be <nooutput>, only <verbal> output is important. For the other questions, both <verbal> and <action> output parts are important.\\nThe 2nd question usually happens when the answer of previous round question 1 is no. The 3rd question usually happens when the answer of previous round question 1 is yes.\\nThere can be different answers to the same question depending on different observation and previous collected information, but the answers should be reasonable. You can imagine the robot is facing different situations when asking the questions.\\n\\nBelow is the list of {TASK}s used in the generated instructions:\\n1. {\\'task\\': \\'Pick up block A and stack it on top of block B\\'}\\n2. {\\'task\\': \\'Pick up block B and stack it on top of block A\\'}\\n\\n\\nBelow is the list of {FUNCTION}s provided in the robot skill library in this environment.\\n\\'\\'\\'\\ndef reach(position, orientation[optional])\\n\\'\\'\\'\\nThe skill of end effector reaching to a desired pose. position is a 3D vector and orientation is a quaternion(optional).\\n\\'\\'\\'\\ndef grasp(object_name)\\n\\'\\'\\'\\nThe skill of grasping an object. object_name is the name of the object to be grasped.\\n\\'\\'\\'\\ndef place(object_name, position, orientation[optional])\\n\\'\\'\\'\\nThe skill of placing an object. object_name is the name of the object to be placed. position is a 3D vector and orientation is a quaternion(optional).\\n\\'\\'\\'\\ndef reset()\\n\\'\\'\\'\\nThe skill of resetting the robot to its initial state.\\n\\n\\n{TRAJECTORY_PLACEHOLDER}\\n\\nHere are some basic requirements for the generated instructions:\\n1. The instructions should be in English.\\n2. The index of instructions for different tasks are continous. For example, if the last instruction for task 1 is 10, the first instruction for task 2 should be 11.\\n3. The i-th response for task {TASK} need to satisfy the following format: \\n// start of instruction pair i, not including this line.\\n###\\ni.\\n<Task> {task}\\n<Instruction> {instruction}\\n<Input> {input}\\n<Output>\\n[verbal] {verbal output}\\n[action] {list of function output}\\n// end of instruction pair i, not including this line.\\n\\n4. The format of {instruction}: If it is first round, then it\\'s just one of the questions listed above. If it\\'s not the first round, then it should be the question attached with the previous N step outputs \"Prev:\\\\n(A_j:{output}_j)\\\\n\" where j=1, ..., N at the begining of instruction. \\n5. The format of {input} will be a vector of robot observation. The input should involve all the states in the robot obvervation. Use actual numbers in the generated instruction pairs.\\n6. The format of {verbal output} will be a sentence explain the current reasoning process and the current planned action. It is used for in-context learning for multi-turn instructions.\\n7. The format of {action output} will be list of {function name} {function parameter} wrapped by []. Each element should be in a python executable form, don\\'t use placeholders as parameters, output the numbers if the parameters are vectors.\\n8. Generate exact 5 instruction pair data for each task.\\n9. Each instruction pair should be separated by a line of \"###\" at the beginning.\\n\\nExamples of instruction pairs are given below.
