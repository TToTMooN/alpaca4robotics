The robot is mounted on a table.\\nThere are multiple blocks on tha table, here we use 2 blocks as example. The blocks are called {block A} and {block B}. \\nThe blocks are initialized at a random position on the table. They have randomized weight, size.\\nThe observation space (when there are two blocks) is a 26 dimension vector, consisting of:\\nblock A position(3), block A orientation(4), block B position(3), block B orientation(4), end effector position(3), end effector orientation(4), end effector force(3), left finger position(1), right finger position(1) \\n\\n[Instruction data Format]\\nThe robot will be given a task: {TASK}. \\nThe instructions and responses happen when the robot is trying to solve this specific {TASK}, and ask a chatbot guider.\\nEach instruction data pair consists of three parts: {instruction}, {input}, {output}\\nThe {instruction} consists of the question asked by the robot to help make decisions.\\nThe {input} consists of the current observation and historical info. \\nThe {output} consists of two parts <verbal> and <action>.\\n    - The <verbal> part describe the reasoning process and explanation for the current planned action if there is any.\\n    - The <action> part include a downstream action provided in the function lists executable by the robot. \\n\\nThe {instruction} of each task consists of the following standard questions in order to provide chain of thought instructions pairs.\\n1. Is the current information enough to solve the task? If not, what information is missing?\\n2. What are the actions the robot should take to gather information?\\n3. What are the actions the robot should take to solve the task?\\nFor the 1st question, the <action> output part should be <nooutput>, only <verbal> output is important. The robot should ask this every time it collects new information. \\nFor the other questions, both <verbal> and <action> output parts are important. The 2nd question usually happens when the answer of previous round question 1 is no. The 3rd question usually happens when the answer of previous round question 1 is yes.\\nWhen generating instruction data, please imagine the observation and previous collected information for the robot, and generate the corresponding {input} and {output}.\\nThere can be different responses to the same question depending on different {input}, imagine different scenarios and generate different responses. \\n\\n[Tasks to solve]\\nBelow is the list of {TASK}s used in the generated instructions:\\n1. {\\'task\\': \\'Pick up block A and stack it on top of block B\\'}\\n2. {\\'task\\': \\'Pick up block B and stack it on top of block A\\'}\\n\\n\\n[Function Lists in skill library]\\n\\'\\'\\'\\ndef reach(position, orientation[optional])\\n\\'\\'\\'\\nThe skill of end effector reaching to a desired pose. position is a 3D vector and orientation is a quaternion(optional).\\n\\'\\'\\'\\ndef grasp(object_name)\\n\\'\\'\\'\\nThe skill of grasping an object. object_name is the name of the object to be grasped. The skill will reach and grasp the object, no need to reach before grasp.\\n\\'\\'\\'\\ndef place(object_name, position, orientation[optional])\\n\\'\\'\\'\\nThe skill of placing an object. object_name is the name of the object to be placed. position is a 3D vector and orientation is a quaternion(optional).\\n\\'\\'\\'\\ndef reset()\\n\\'\\'\\'\\nThe skill of resetting the robot to its initial state.\\n\\n\\n[Example trajectories]\\nBelow is some example trajectories(sequence of obs) when executing some skills. Use them as reference for observations when generating instructions. If no example trajectory is provided, use your own imagination.\\n{TRAJECTORY_PLACEHOLDER}\\n\\n[Format of generated instructions]\\n1. The index of instructions for different tasks are continous. For example, if the last instruction for task 1 is 10, the first instruction for task 2 should be 11.\\n2. The i-th response for task {TASK} need to satisfy the following format: \\n// start of instruction pair i, not including this line.\\n###\\ni.\\n<Task> {task}\\n<Instruction> {instruction}\\n<Input> {input}\\n<Output>\\n[verbal] {verbal output}\\n[action] {list of function output}\\n// end of instruction pair i, not including this line.\\n\\n3. You are expected to generate the full chain of thoughts instructions for each task from initial condition until the task is solved. At some steps, if there are multiple possible feecback observations, you can generate multiple instructions and next-step instruction data pairs.\\nYou need to generate the instructions in order. Generate instructions for task 1 first, then task 2, ..., task N. \\n4. The format of {instruction}: It\\'s usually one of the questions listed above.\\n5. The format of {input} will be a vector of robot observation, followed by a list of historical information. Use actual numbers in the vectors. The format is: \\nCurrent:\\\\n[observation]\\\\nPast:\\\\n[hist text 1] [hist action list 1] [hist obs list 1]\\\\n[hist text 2] [hist action list 2] [hist obs list 2]\\\\n ...\\n[hist text] [hist action list] are the previous rounds explanation and action sequence, [hist obs list] is the observation after the action executions in previous rounds. The number of hist obs should correspond to the number of actions in hist action list. \\n6. The format of {verbal output} will be a sentence explain the current reasoning process and the current planned action. It is used for in-context learning for multi-turn instructions.\\n7. The format of {action output} will be list of {function name} {function parameter} wrapped by []. Each element should be in a python executable form, don\\'t use placeholders as parameters, output the numbers if the parameters are vectors.\\n8. Each instruction pair should be separated by a line of \"###\" at the beginning.\\n9. Each task should have at most 10 instruction pairs.\\n\\nExamples of instruction pairs for a single turn are given below. Note that this could be instructions under different {TASK}s in different rounds.

They have randomized weight, size.\\nThe observation space (when there are two blocks) is a 26 dimension vector, consisting of:\\nblock A position(3), block A orientation(4), block B position(3), block B orientation(4), end effector position(3), end effector orientation(4), end effector force(3), left finger position(1), right finger position(1) \\n\\n[Instruction data Format]\\nThe robot will be given a task: {TASK}. \\nThe instructions and responses happen when the robot is trying to solve this specific {TASK}, and ask a chatbot guider.\\nEach instruction data pair consists of three parts: {instruction}, {input}, {output}\\nThe {instruction} consists of the question asked by the robot to help make decisions.\\nThe {input} consists of the current observation and historical info. \\nThe {output} consists of two parts <verbal> and <action>.\\n    - The <verbal> part describe the reasoning process and explanation for the current planned action if there is any.\\n    - The <action> part include a downstream action provided in the function lists executable by the robot. \\n\\nThe {instruction} of each task consists of the following standard questions in order to provide chain of thought instructions pairs.\\n1. Is the current information enough to solve the task? If not, what information is missing?\\n2. What are the actions the robot should take to gather information?\\n3. What are the actions the robot should take to solve the task?\\nFor the 1st question, the <action> output part should be <nooutput>, only <verbal> output is important. The robot should ask this every time it collects new information. \\nFor the other questions, both <verbal> and <action> output parts are important. The 2nd question usually happens when the answer of previous round question 1 is no. The 3rd question usually happens when the answer of previous round question 1 is yes.\\nWhen generating instruction data, please imagine the observation and previous collected information for the robot, and generate the corresponding {input} and {output}.\\nThere can be different responses to the same question depending on different {input}, imagine different scenarios and generate different responses. \\n\\n[Tasks to solve]\\nBelow is the list of {TASK}s used in the generated instructions:\\n1. {\\'task\\': \\'Perform a controlled move of block A to the edge of the table without it falling\\'}\\n2. {\\'task\\': \\'Perform a controlled move of block B to the edge of the table without it falling\\'}\\n\\n\\n[Function Lists in skill library]\\n\\'\\'\\'\\ndef reach(position, orientation[optional])\\n\\'\\'\\'\\nThe skill of end effector reaching to a desired pose. position is a 3D vector and orientation is a quaternion(optional).\\n\\'\\'\\'\\ndef grasp(object_name)\\n\\'\\'\\'\\nThe skill of grasping an object. object_name is the name of the object to be grasped.

The robot is mounted on a table.\\nThere are multiple blocks on tha table, here we use 2 blocks as example. The blocks are called {block A} and {block B}. \\nThe blocks are initialized at a random position on the table. They have randomized weight, size.\\nThe observation space (when there are two blocks) is a 26 dimension vector, consisting of:\\nblock A position(3), block A orientation(4), block B position(3), block B orientation(4), end effector position(3), end effector orientation(4), end effector force(3), left finger position(1), right finger position(1) \\n\\n[Instruction data Format]\\nThe robot will be given a task: {TASK}. \\nThe instructions and responses happen when the robot is trying to solve this specific {TASK}, and ask a chatbot guider.\\nEach instruction data pair consists of three parts: {instruction}, {input}, {output}\\nThe {instruction} consists of the question asked by the robot to help make decisions.\\nThe {input} consists of the current observation and historical info. \\nThe {output} consists of two parts <verbal> and <action>.\\n    - The <verbal> part describe the reasoning process and explanation for the current planned action if there is any.\\n    - The <action> part include a downstream action provided in the function lists executable by the robot. \\n\\nThe {instruction} of each task consists of the following standard questions in order to provide chain of thought instructions pairs.\\n1. Is the current information enough to solve the task? If not, what information is missing?\\n2. What are the actions the robot should take to gather information?\\n3. What are the actions the robot should take to solve the task?\\nFor the 1st question, the <action> output part should be <nooutput>, only <verbal> output is important. The robot should ask this every time it collects new information. \\nFor the other questions, both <verbal> and <action> output parts are important. The 2nd question usually happens when the answer of previous round question 1 is no. The 3rd question usually happens when the answer of previous round question 1 is yes.\\nWhen generating instruction data, please imagine the observation and previous collected information for the robot, and generate the corresponding {input} and {output}.\\nThere can be different responses to the same question depending on different {input}, imagine different scenarios and generate different responses. \\n\\n[Tasks to solve]\\nBelow is the list of {TASK}s used in the generated instructions:\\n\\n\\n[Function Lists in skill library]\\n\\'\\'\\'\\ndef reach(position, orientation[optional])\\n\\'\\'\\'\\nThe skill of end effector reaching to a desired pose. position is a 3D vector and orientation is a quaternion(optional).\\n\\'\\'\\'\\ndef grasp(object_name)\\n\\'\\'\\'\\nThe skill of grasping an object. object_name is the name of the object to be grasped. The skill will reach and grasp the object, no need to reach before grasp.\\n\\'\\'\\'\\ndef place(object_name, position, orientation[optional])\\n\\'\\'\\'\\nThe skill of placing an object. object_name is the name of the object to be placed. position is a 3D vector and orientation is a quaternion(optional).\\n\\'\\'\\'\\ndef reset()\\n\\'\\'\\'\\nThe skill of resetting the robot to its initial state.\\n\\n\\n[Example trajectories]\\nBelow is some example trajectories(sequence of obs) when executing some skills.

You are expected to generate the full chain of thoughts instructions for each task from initial condition until the task is solved. At some steps, if there are multiple possible feecback observations, you can generate multiple instructions and next-step instruction data pairs.\\nYou need to generate the instructions in order. Generate instructions for task 1 first, then task 2, ..., task N. \\n4. The format of {instruction}: It\\'s usually one of the questions listed above.\\n5.

Is the current information enough to solve the task? If not, what information is missing?\\n2. What are the actions the robot should take to gather information?\\n3. What are the actions the robot should take to solve the task?\\nFor the 1st question, the <action> output part should be <nooutput>, only <verbal> output is important. The robot should ask this every time it collects new information. \\nFor the other questions, both <verbal> and <action> output parts are important. The 2nd question usually happens when the answer of previous round question 1 is no. The 3rd question usually happens when the answer of previous round question 1 is yes.\\nWhen generating instruction data, please imagine the observation and previous collected information for the robot, and generate the corresponding {input} and {output}.\\nThere can be different responses to the same question depending on different {input}, imagine different scenarios and generate different responses. \\n\\n[Tasks to solve]\\nBelow is the list of {TASK}s used in the generated instructions:\\n\\n\\n[Function Lists in skill library]\\n\\'\\'\\'\\ndef reach(position, orientation[optional])\\n\\'\\'\\'\\nThe skill of end effector reaching to a desired pose. position is a 3D vector and orientation is a quaternion(optional).\\n\\'\\'\\'\\ndef grasp(object_name)\\n\\'\\'\\'\\nThe skill of grasping an object. object_name is the name of the object to be grasped.

Is the current information enough to solve the task? If not, what information is missing?\\n2. What are the actions the robot should take to gather information?\\n3. What are the actions the robot should take to solve the task?\\nFor the 1st question, the <action> output part should be <nooutput>, only <verbal> output is important. The robot should ask this every time it collects new information. \\nFor the other questions, both <verbal> and <action> output parts are important. The 2nd question usually happens when the answer of previous round question 1 is no. The 3rd question usually happens when the answer of previous round question 1 is yes.\\nWhen generating instruction data, please imagine the observation and previous collected information for the robot, and generate the corresponding {input} and {output}.\\nThere can be different responses to the same question depending on different {input}, imagine different scenarios and generate different responses. \\n\\n[Tasks to solve]\\nBelow is the list of {TASK}s used in the generated instructions:\\n\\n\\n[Function Lists in skill library]\\n\\'\\'\\'\\ndef reach(position, orientation[optional])\\n\\'\\'\\'\\nThe skill of end effector reaching to a desired pose. position is a 3D vector and orientation is a quaternion(optional).\\n\\'\\'\\'\\ndef grasp(object_name)\\n\\'\\'\\'\\nThe skill of grasping an object. object_name is the name of the object to be grasped.

      "### [[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will be given a set of tasks in a robotic environment.\\nYou are asked to simulate the task instructions and corresponding responses happening during task solving.\\nSome of them are long-horizon tasks request multiple reasoning steps, so we are generating multi-turn instructions in a chain of thought way. \\nThese task instructions will be given to a GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model performance on the generated responses.\\n\\n[Environment Description] \\nThe environment is called \"Block World\". \\nThere is a 7DOF Franka Panda robot with a parallel gripper, it has a force sensor on the end effector. The robot is mounted on a table.\\nThere are multiple blocks on tha table, here we use 2 blocks as example. The blocks are called {block A} and {block B}. \\nThe blocks are initialized at a random position on the table. They have randomized weight, size.\\nThe observation space (when there are two blocks) is a 26 dimension vector, consisting of:\\nblock A position(3), block A orientation(4), block B position(3), block B orientation(4), end effector position(3), end effector orientation(4), end effector force(3), left finger position(1), right finger position(1) \\n\\n[Instruction data Format]\\nThe robot will be given a task: {TASK}. \\nThe instructions and responses happen when the robot is trying to solve this specific {TASK}, and ask a chatbot guider.\\nEach instruction data pair consists of three parts: {instruction}, {input}, {output}\\nThe {instruction} consists of the question asked by the robot to help make decisions.\\nThe {input} consists of the current observation and historical info. \\nThe {output} consists of two parts <verbal> and <action>.\\n    - The <verbal> part describe the reasoning process and explanation for the current planned action if there is any.\\n    - The <action> part include a downstream action provided in the function lists executable by the robot. \\n\\nThe {instruction} of each task consists of the following standard questions in order to provide chain of thought instructions pairs.\\n1. Is the current information enough to solve the task? If not, what information is missing?\\n2. What are the actions the robot should take to gather information?\\n3. What are the actions the robot should take to solve the task?\\nFor the 1st question, the <action> output part should be <nooutput>, only <verbal> output is important. The robot should ask this every time it collects new information. \\nFor the other questions, both <verbal> and <action> output parts are important. The 2nd question usually happens when the answer of previous round question 1 is no. The 3rd question usually happens when the answer of previous round question 1 is yes.\\nWhen generating instruction data, please imagine the observation and previous collected information for the robot, and generate the corresponding {input} and {output}.\\nThere can be different responses to the same question depending on different {input}, imagine different scenarios and generate different responses. \\n\\n[Tasks to solve]\\nBelow is the list of {TASK}s used in the generated instructions:\\n\\n\\n[Function Lists in skill library]\\n\\'\\'\\'\\ndef reach(position, orientation[optional])\\n\\'\\'\\'\\nThe skill of end effector reaching to a desired pose. position is a 3D vector and orientation is a quaternion(optional).\\n\\'\\'\\'\\ndef grasp(object_name)\\n\\'\\'\\'\\nThe skill of grasping an object. object_name is the name of the object to be grasped. The skill will reach and grasp the object, no need to reach before grasp.\\n\\'\\'\\'\\ndef place(object_name, position, orientation[optional])\\n\\'\\'\\'\\nThe skill of placing an object. object_name is the name of the object to be placed. position is a 3D vector and orientation is a quaternion(optional).\\n\\'\\'\\'\\ndef reset()\\n\\'\\'\\'\\nThe skill of resetting the robot to its initial state.\\n\\n\\n[Example trajectories]\\nBelow is some example trajectories(sequence of obs) when executing some skills. Use them as reference for observations when generating instructions. If no example trajectory is provided, use your own imagination.\\n{TRAJECTORY_PLACEHOLDER}\\n\\n[Format of generated instructions]\\n1. The index of instructions for different tasks are continous. For example, if the last instruction for task 1 is 10, the first instruction for task 2 should be 11.\\n2. The i-th response for task {TASK} need to satisfy the following format: \\n// start of instruction pair i, not including this line.\\n###\\ni.\\n<Task> {task}\\n<Instruction> {instruction}\\n<Input> {input}\\n<Output>\\n[verbal] {verbal output}\\n[action] {list of function output}\\n// end of instruction pair i, not including this line.\\n\\n3. You are expected to generate the full chain of thoughts instructions for each task from initial condition until the task is solved. At some steps, if there are multiple possible feecback observations, you can generate multiple instructions and next-step instruction data pairs.\\nYou need to generate the instructions in order. Generate instructions for task 1 first, then task 2, ..., task N. \\n4. The format of {instruction}: It\\'s usually one of the questions listed above.\\n5. The format of {input} will be a vector of robot observation, followed by a list of historical information. Use actual numbers in the vectors. The format is: \\nCurrent:\\\\n[observation]\\\\nPast:\\\\n[hist text 1] [hist action list 1] [hist obs list 1]\\\\n[hist text 2] [hist action list 2] [hist obs list 2]\\\\n ...\\n[hist text] [hist action list] are the previous rounds explanation and action sequence, [hist obs list] is the observation after the action executions in previous rounds. The number of hist obs should correspond to the number of actions in hist action list. \\n6. The format of {verbal output} will be a sentence explain the current reasoning process and the current planned action. It is used for in-context learning for multi-turn instructions.\\n7. The format of {action output} will be list of {function name} {function parameter} wrapped by []. Each element should be in a python executable form, don\\'t use placeholders as parameters, output the numbers if the parameters are vectors.\\n8. Each instruction pair should be separated by a line of \"###\" at the beginning.\\n9. Each task should have at most 10 instruction pairs.\\n\\nExamples of instruction pairs for a single turn are given below. Note that this could be instructions under different {TASK}s in different rounds. You need to modify the instruction pairs according to the {TASK}.\\n\\n###\\n <Task> stack the heavier on the ligher block\\n <Instruction> Is the current information enough to solve the task?
